  <summary>A secure and free password manager for all of your devices</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      Bitwarden is the easiest and safest way to store all of your logins and passwords while conveniently keeping them
      synced between all of your devices. Bitwarden is 100% open source software. The source code for Bitwarden is
      hosted on GitHub and everyone is free to review, audit, and contribute to the Bitwarden codebase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bitwarden stores all of your logins in an encrypted vault that syncs across all of your devices. Since it's fully
      encrypted before it ever leaves your device, only you have access to your data. Not even the team at Bitwarden can
      read your data, even if we wanted to. Your data is sealed with AES-256 bit encryption, salted hashing, and PBKDF2
      SHA-256.
